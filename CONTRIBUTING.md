## Adding messages
If you are editing a command and adding a new message you should include a **good** translation in all supported languages (English, Spanish and Catalan). If you can't do it, please say it in the pull request and we will translate it.

## Adding commands
When you add a command, you should include an alias for all languages. You also must edit the `doc/alias.json` and `doc/commands.json` to add the documentation. If you have any doubts, ask in the pull request.
